  crawlText: "WIN\r\nThe bank assured you that there was no suspicious activity on
    grandma\u2019s account. The number that called you has been a scam. \r\n\r\nAndrew
    asked for your number to more easily keep him updated on grandma\u2019s cyber
    security: a strange ask that you humored.\r\n\r\nThe first text he sent was about
    a suspicious charge, but it was one that grandma had told him over and over was
    her \u201Cspending her money as she pleased.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my personal
    curiosity, could you find out who \u2018Rufus\u2019 is and why Grandma sends
    him so much money?\r\n\r\nGrandma Is Safe!\r\nFor now"
